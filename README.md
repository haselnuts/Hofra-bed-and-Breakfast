## Introduction
During my eductation to be a programmer I had to commit different MileStone Projects. The first project was to show my skills in HTML and CSS. 
This project was called [*Hofra-Bed-Breakfast*](https://github.com/haselnuts/Hofra-Bed-Breakfast). 
Now I attempt to use Flask and Python to simplify the structure of this project. The project should still show:

A genuine website for my friends Hofra Bed & Breakfast. The website features a welcome page, information on the rooms, the barn, pricing, 
interesting destinations and inviting images.

There will be changes to this website in the future along with my learning progress. 
I'm still excited to provide a website for my friends business but due my second project which included JavaScript I'm even more nervous today than I was then.

- Provide interesting destination nearby, Dellendistrict shall be the final destination
